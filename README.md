## Description

## Development

1. Wireframed the different pages including: a start page with a short description, a quiz page, an end page, and a highscore page. Mapped out which parts would be moving or have events attached to them (buttons, input bars, etc.).
2. Added basic HTML structure including a nav bar, and four different main sections to emulate mulitple webpages. Created placeholders for moving parts like the answers and highscore boards.
3. Added basic CSS.
